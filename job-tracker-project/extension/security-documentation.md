# Security Documentation - Job Application Tracker Extension

## Security Overview

The Job Application Tracker extension is built with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security measures, practices, and the steps we take to protect user data and ensure safe operation.

## Extension Security Architecture

### Manifest V3 Compliance
- **Latest Security Standards**: Built using Chrome's Manifest V3 for enhanced security
- **Minimal Permissions**: Requests only essential permissions for core functionality
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP prevents code injection and XSS attacks
- **Service Worker**: Background tasks run in isolated service worker environment

### Permission Model
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "storage",           // Local data storage only
    "activeTab"          // Access current tab when user activates extension
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://linkedin.com/*",      // Job site access for extraction
    "https://indeed.com/*",        // Limited to job sites only
    "https://glassdoor.com/*",     // No broad web access
    // ... other job sites
  ]
}
```

## Data Security

### Encryption
- **Data in Transit**: All API communications use TLS 1.3 encryption
- **Data at Rest**: Local storage encrypted using browser's built-in encryption
- **Cloud Sync**: End-to-end encryption for optional cloud synchronization
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation from user credentials

### Local Storage Security
- **Browser Sandbox**: Data stored in browser's secure storage sandbox
- **Origin Isolation**: Data isolated per browser profile and origin
- **No External Access**: Extension data cannot be accessed by websites
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary data cleared on extension uninstall

### Data Minimization
- **Selective Extraction**: Only job-related data is extracted and stored
- **User Consent**: All data collection requires explicit user action
- **Regular Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary and cached data
- **Retention Limits**: Data retention policies to minimize stored information

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Content Script Security
```javascript
// Example of input sanitization
function sanitizeJobData(data) {
  return {
    title: DOMPurify.sanitize(data.title),
    company: DOMPurify.sanitize(data.company),
    location: DOMPurify.sanitize(data.location),
    description: DOMPurify.sanitize(data.description)
  };
}
```

### XSS Prevention
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents script injection
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized before storage
- **DOM Purification**: HTML content cleaned using DOMPurify
- **Safe DOM Manipulation**: No innerHTML with unsanitized content

### SQL Injection Prevention
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all data inputs
- **Type Checking**: Strict type checking for all database operations

## Network Security

### API Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications use HTTPS with certificate pinning
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiration times
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Policy**: Strict CORS policy limiting cross-origin requests

### Request Validation
```javascript
// Example of secure API request
async function secureAPICall(endpoint, data) {
  const token = await getValidToken();
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}${endpoint}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-Requested-With': 'JobTrackerExtension'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(sanitizeData(data))
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new SecurityError('Request failed security validation');
  }
  
  return response.json();
}
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication
- **Secure Password Handling**: Passwords hashed using bcrypt with salt
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for enhanced security
- **Token Management**: JWT tokens with automatic refresh and revocation
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with proper timeouts

### Access Controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only access their own data
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for different features
- **Data Isolation**: User data completely isolated between accounts
- **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant actions logged for monitoring

## Extension Isolation

### Content Script Isolation
- **Isolated World**: Content scripts run in isolated JavaScript world
- **Message Passing**: Secure communication via Chrome's message passing API
- **No Direct DOM Access**: Background scripts cannot directly access page DOM
- **Event Validation**: All events validated before processing

### Background Script Security
- **Service Worker Model**: Background tasks run in secure service worker
- **Limited Scope**: Background script has minimal permissions
- **Message Validation**: All messages validated for authenticity
- **Resource Limits**: Automatic resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Vulnerability Management
