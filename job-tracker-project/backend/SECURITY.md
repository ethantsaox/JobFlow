## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-at-least-32-characters-long
PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8
PASSWORD_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
PASSWORD_LOCKOUT_MINUTES=15
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=5
ENABLE_CORS=true
ENABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION=false

```

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] **JWT_SECRET_KEY**: Set to cryptographically secure 32+ character string
- [ ] **DATABASE_URL**: Use PostgreSQL with encrypted connections
- [ ] **CORS_ORIGINS**: Set to your exact production domains only
- [ ] **ENABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION**: Set to `true`
- [ ] **ENVIRONMENT**: Set to `production`
- [ ] **DEBUG**: Set to `false`
- [ ] **SSL certificates**: Configure HTTPS/TLS properly
- [ ] **Firewall**: Configure appropriate network security
- [ ] **Database**: Enable encryption at rest
- [ ] **Backups**: Set up encrypted database backups
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Configure log aggregation and alerting

## üö® Security Features in Detail

### 1. Password Security Policy

```python
# Automatically enforced on registration/password change
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase letter
- Must contain number  
- Must contain special character
- Rejects common passwords (password, 123456, etc.)
- Rejects keyboard patterns (qwerty, 123456, etc.)
- Limits repeated characters
```

### 2. JWT Token Security

```python
# Token includes security claims:
{
  "sub": "user-id",           # Subject (user ID)
  "exp": 1234567890,          # Expiration
  "iat": 1234567890,          # Issued at
  "iss": "jobflow-api",       # Issuer
  "aud": "jobflow-client",    # Audience
  "jti": "unique-token-id",   # JWT ID for blacklisting
  "token_type": "access",     # Token type
  "sig": "data-signature"     # Tamper detection
}
```

### 3. Privacy Controls

Users can control visibility of:
- Profile information
- Application statistics
- Achievements
- Activity history
- Online status
- Email address

Visibility levels:
- **Public**: Visible to everyone
- **Friends**: Visible to accepted friends only
- **Private**: Visible only to the user

### 4. Data Access Control

```python
# Example: User can only access their own job applications
def get_user_applications(current_user, target_user_id):
    if current_user.id != target_user_id:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Access denied")
    
    # Apply privacy filters based on friendship status
    return filter_user_data(applications, current_user, target_user)
```

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

The application includes automated security validation:

1. **Startup Validation**: Security configuration is validated on application start
2. **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for suspicious patterns
3. **Token Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
4. **Privacy Auditing**: Regular audits of data exposure

### Manual Security Testing

Before deployment, test these security features:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Try invalid credentials
   - Test account lockout after failed attempts
   - Verify token expiration handling

2. **Authorization**:
   - Attempt to access other users' data
   - Test API endpoints without authentication
   - Verify privacy settings enforcement

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Test SQL injection patterns
   - Try XSS payloads
   - Send oversized requests

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Send rapid requests to test rate limits
   - Test from different IPs
   - Verify lockout behavior

## üöë Incident Response

### Security Event Response

1. **Failed Login Attacks**:
   - Automatic account lockout
   - IP-based rate limiting
   - Security team notification (if configured)

2. **Suspicious Request Patterns**:
   - Automatic request blocking
   - Pattern logging for analysis
   - Rate limit enforcement

3. **Data Breach Prevention**:
   - Privacy controls prevent unauthorized access
   - Audit logging tracks all data access
   - Automatic sensitive data filtering

### Security Monitoring

Monitor these log patterns:
- `SECURITY - WARNING`: Failed authentication attempts
- `SECURITY - ERROR`: Malicious request patterns detected
- High-frequency requests from single IPs
- Unusual data access patterns
